An emotionally powerful and intimate musical about two New Yorkers in their twenties who fall in and out of love over the course of five years, the show's unconventional structure consists of Cathy, the woman, telling her story backwards while Jamie, the man, tells his story chronologically; the two characters only meet once, at their wedding in the middle of the show.

Featuring a two-person cast, *The Last Five Years* is a great opportunity for actors with both range and stamina. This intimate musical is perfect for small theatre companies and black box venues.
