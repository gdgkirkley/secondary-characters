Little Women is a classic tale that follows the lives of four very different sisters: Meg, Jo, Beth and Amy, who teach us about life as they learn to navigate their own. Along the way the girls befriend the 'neighbour boy' Laurie, welcoming him into their family circle while enjoying his boyish antics. They are guided by Marmee, their ever wise mother who understands that experience is the best teacher. Together their adventures range from creating stories and making new friends, to discovering new places and learning  about love while all the while they give us a sense of family spirit that never dies.
