Welcome to the Renaissance, where we follow two brothers, Nick and Nigel Bottom, playwrights desperate to outshine their contemporary rival, the wildly successful Willam Shakespeare. Packed with larger-than-life characters, show-stopping numbers, and clever nods to musical theatre history, ***Something Rotten!*** is a laugh-out-loud love letter to Broadway and the chaos of creativity. 

Something Rotten! Is presented through special arrangement with Music Theatre International (MTI). All authorized performance materials are also supplied by MTI. www.mtishows.com
