<blockquote>
<h2>Announcement</h2>
It is with sadness that Secondary Characters has postponed our summer production of <i>Mamma Mia!</i> and any upcoming fundraisers and events in response to the COVID-19 pandemic.

The health and safety of our artists, volunteers and patrons is paramount. We want to thank all of the individuals who have worked hard in preparation for <i>Mamma Mia</i> as we know the impact of this loss is enormous not only for our artists but for Secondary Characters as well.

We thank you for your support and understanding during this difficult time, and next year when things return to normal, we invite you back to the theatre to re-experience the joy of family, community, creativity and music.

</blockquote>

The story-telling magic of ABBA's timeless songs propels this enchanting tale of love, laughter and friendship, creating an unforgettable show. A large cast, non-stop laughs and explosive dance numbers combine to make Mamma Mia! a guaranteed smash hit for any theatre. A mother. A daughter. Three possible dads. And a trip down the aisle you'll never forget!
