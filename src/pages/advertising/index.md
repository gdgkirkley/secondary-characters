Ads are printed on 80lb glossy paper stock, 8.5" x 5.5", and will appear in each of our programs for a show . Ads will reach all audience members directly, and programs and information are often shared among friends for community theatre productions, creating a strong word-of-mouth marketing presence. We offer four types of advertising in our program:

- Full page ad \$250 - includes 4 complimentary tickets and premium locations/colour printing available at no extra cost
- Half page ad \$160 - includes 2 complimentary tickets
- Quarter page ad \$80
- Friend listing \$10-70
