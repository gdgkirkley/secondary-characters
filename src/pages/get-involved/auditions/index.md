      \*Secondary Characters is committed to casting with a focus on diversity,
      equity, and inclusion.  All are welcome to audition for any role.


      *With the exception of King Arthur, Lady of the Lake, and Lancelot, roles will be cast gender-blind as we do not feel gender to be of high importance due to the goofy antics, costuming and general silliness of this show.*


       *This show contains terribly unrealistic depictions of violence and some inappropriate language.*
