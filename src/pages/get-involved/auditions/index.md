      Set in the 1590's, brothers Nick and Nigel Bottom are desperate to write a
      hit play but are stuck in the shadow of that Renaissance rock star known
      as "The Bard" (William Shakespeare).  When a local soothsayer foetells
      that the future of theatre involves singing, dancing and acting at the
      same time, Nick and Nigel set out to write the world's very first
      musical.  But amidst the scandelous excitment of opening night, the Bottom
      Brothers realize that reaching the top means being true to thine own
      self....and all that jazz.


      *S﻿omething Rotten* features large song and dance numbers, and an eccentric cast of over-the-top characters, each given their own special moment in the show to shine.
