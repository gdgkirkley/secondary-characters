      The Cat in the Hat tells the story of Horton, an elephant who discovers a speck of dust that contains the Whos, including Jojo, a Who child sent off to military school for thinking too many "thinks." Horton faces a double challenge: not only must he protect the Whos from a world of naysayers and dangers, but he must guard an abandoned egg, left in his care by the irresponsible Mayzie La Bird. 


      Although Horton faces ridicule, danger, kidnapping and a trial, the intrepid Gertrude McFuzz never loses faith in him. Ultimately, the powers of friendship, loyalty, family and community are challenged and emerge triumphant.

      ###### **CASTING:** 


      Character Breakdown


      ​


      THE CAT IN THE HAT


      The Cat In The Hat is the essence of mischief, fun, and imagination. The Cat stirs things up, causes trouble, but always sets things right again, helping Jojo to discover the power of his own imagination as they create the story for the show together. Look for a physically adept actor (male or female) to play The Cat, one who will be able to play many comic cameos and is comfortable improvising with an audience. The Cat does not need to be your strongest singer, but should still have good rhythm and timing.


      Gender: Both


      Vocal range top: D6


      Vocal range bottom: Bb4


      ​


      JOJO


      Jojo is a "Thinker", a smart child with a wild imagination. He can be played as being a little bit awkward, a little bit of a loner, or simply a rambunctious kid whose Thinks get him into constant trouble. By the end of the show, he learns what it means to be a responsible member of his world, using the power and possibilities of his own Thinks. He should be one of your stronger singers.


      Gender: Male


      Vocal range top: D6


      Vocal range bottom: Ab4


      ​


      HORTON THE ELEPHANT


      Horton The Elephant is a gentle giant. Think of him as a big-hearted blue-collar guy who is steadfast, responsible and always tries to do the right thing for his friends. He is imaginative and receptive to the world around him. He is very unselfconscious. Horton's view of the world never changes - he believes in its goodness. By the end of the show, without even realizing it, he is ready to become a parent.


      Gender: Male


      Vocal range top: E6


      Vocal range bottom: A4


      ​


      GERTRUDE MCFUZZ


      Gertrude Mcfuzz is very self-conscious and aware that her one-feather tail isn't perfect. Gertrude changes during the show from a neurotic, nervous and shy bird into one with the power to protect and care for a baby elephant bird and commit herself to Horton. In other words, she stops worrying about her looks and grows up.


      Gender: Female


      Vocal range top: Eb5


      Vocal range bottom: F3
