Secondary Characters' is looking to expand it's volunteer database! If you would like to support SC and enjoy some time with like-minded live theatre audience members and performers, please consider joining the database. We will contact you occasionally when we are looking for help, and you are welcome to choose only events that interest you and fit with your schedule. You may withdraw at any time.

Events could include:

- working backstage
- handing out flyers at Party in the Park and other outdoor summer events
- selling Krispy Kremes
- helping out at our table at Cultural Collaboration in September

If you would like to sign up for our volunteer database, please fill out the form below. Thanks for your support and we look forward to working with you!
