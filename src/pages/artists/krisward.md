Kris is both an enthusiastic perform and avid woodworker. He combines these two passions as Secondary Characters' resident Set Designer, having designed and built Notre Dame Cathedral for _The Hunchback of Notre Dame_ and this year's set for _The 25th Annual Putnam County Spelling Bee_. Some of Kris' favourite onstage credits have included St. Aphrodisius (_Hunchback of Notre Dame_) and the villainous aristocrat, Braxton Prendergast as well as the timid Mr. Lawrence ([_Little Women_](/shows/little-women)). When not working backstage on shows, Kris has been working on his Cabinetmaker Apprenticeship through both North Island College and BCIT.
