Madeline is 21 years old and is going into her final year of the Elementary Teacher Education Program at the University of Victoria. This is her third production with Secondary Characters, as she had roles in both The Wizard of Oz and The Hunchback of Notre Dame. She is very excited to be back on the stage and would like to thank her family and friends for supporting her! Have a great show everyone!
