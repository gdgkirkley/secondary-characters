A self-confessed student for life, Steffi holds a Diploma in Theatre Performance from Douglas College, a Bachelor of Fine Arts Degree with a Major in Theatre Performance from the School of Contemporary Arts at Simon Fraser University, and a Bachelor of Education with a Minor in Environmental Education also from SFU. When not moonlighting as a children’s theatre director, Steffi spends her days teaching grade 4/5 for Squiala First Nation.

A prolific educator, Steffi has spent many years teaching theatre to youth in Chilliwack, the Fraser Valley, and as far away as Nunavut. Steffi has performed all over the Fraser Valley with Secondary Characters, Chilliwack Musical Theatre, the Chilliwack School of Performing Arts, the Fraser Valley Gilbert and Sullivan Society, Douglas College, Simon Fraser University, the University of the Fraser Valley, Troika Collective, and 591 Productions. Some of her favourite onstage performance credits include Jo ([_Little Women_](/shows/little-women), Secondary Characters Musical Theatre), Maria (_West Side Story_, Chilliwack Musical Theatre), and Alice (_the Alice_, SFU School for Contemporary Arts). Performing everything from classics to contemporaries and from opera to absurdism, Steffi loves creating newly imagined works of art.

In what little spare time she has left, Steffi also loves working backstage in theatre having stage managed, dramaturged, artistic directed, directed, musical directed, and designed many shows in both Chilliwack and Vancouver. Recently, she has directed for Secondary Characters Musical Theatre including _The Wizard of Oz_ and _The Last Five Years_ which had a successful remount at both the RickRack in the ‘Wack Festival and the Harrison Festival of the Arts. Steffi is resident production manager for Secondary Characters Musical Theatre and most recently set/props/costume designed and assistant directed their July 2018 production of _The Hunchback of Notre Dame_.
