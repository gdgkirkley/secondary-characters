Jeff is elated to join Secondary Characters again for their production of Mamma Mia! Having the music of ABBA influence his early years, it’s been a joy for Jeff to be a part of this team. Jeff previously performed in Secondary Characters’ 2016 production of The Wizard of Oz. Jeff is a Middle School Math and Science teacher and has raised three children with his wife, Patti. In some form, the entire Hanson clan has been involved with musical theatre. Jeff would like to thank his supportive family for giving him the inspiration to keep performing, as well as Steffi, Ann, Paula, and Michael. Enjoy the show!
