Taya is a Grade 8 French Immersion student at Vedder Middle School. Taya has been dancing since she was six, and joined the Creative Outlet competitive team in 2016. Taya performed in The Nutcracker (Ballet Victoria) and has nearly completed her syllabus for the Royal Academy of Dance. Taya’s favourite styles of dance are contemporary, hip-hop, and lyrical. When she’s not dancing, Taya loves to bake, read, and camp. Taya is grateful for the opportunity to perform in Sweeney Todd. Taya would like to thank Debra Cross and all of her teachers for their support.
