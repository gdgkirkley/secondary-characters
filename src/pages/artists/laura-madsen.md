Laura began pursuing her musical interests through classical piano but finds being a part of vocal harmonies infinitely varied and exhilarating. She has enjoyed acting in productions of Snow White (Chilliwack Players Guild), Guys and Dolls and HMS Pinafore with Judy Russell in Prince George, The Hunchback of Notre Dame (Secondary Characters), and in the chorus of Susanna (Denman Island Baroque Festival). In the past few years, she has enjoyed singing a cappella with the Green Mountain Quintet and is currently part of Paula Quick’s Philharmonic Chorus. Laura is thrilled to be part of Secondary Characters’ production of Mamma Mia, and hopes the joy and energy of this production will make you want to hug the people you love and sing all the way home!
