Audiences may remember you as Joseph in Joseph and the Amazing Technicolor Dreamcoat. What was your favourite part of doing that show?

That was my first production with SC. Joseph has always been one of my favourite musicals, so getting to play Joseph was pretty great.

What do you do when youâ€™re not working on a show?

When I'm not doing shows I'm working as an electrician.

What are you plans for next year?

Next year my plans are to return to school to start a degree in applied physics.
