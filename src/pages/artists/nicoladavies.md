Pianist Nicola Davies divides her time between opera & musical theatre, recitals, teaching, and working behind the scenes in the arts. Her theatre work encompasses well over thirty productions as music director and pianist, including *Carmen* with Opera Kelowna, *La Bohème* with Opera NUOVA as assistant conductor, and musicals with Secondary Characters, Gallery 7, and University of the Fraser Valley Theatre.  She freelances as a collaborative pianist, and has taught piano and voice for many years. 

Nicola has instigated various projects, including Secondary Characters Musical Theatre, for which she was Co-Artistic Director for nine years. She since became the Executive Director and Co-Founder of Living Room Live, an organization that creates tours of classical house concerts in homes and other intimate venues across western Canada.  

As a participant at the Vancouver International Song Institute and the Franz Schubert Institute in Austria, Nicola has studied with such teachers as Julius Drake, Roger Vignoles, Elly Ameling, and Margo Garrett. Formal studies have included a Masters in Collaborative Piano at the University of Manitoba with Dr. Laura Loewen and Dr. Judy Kehler Siebert, a Diploma in Voice Performance, a Certificate in Conducting, and a Bachelor of Science.
