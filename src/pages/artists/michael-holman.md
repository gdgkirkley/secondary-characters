Michael is excited to be making his return to the stage as a villain. Michael's favourite acting credits include Jamie Wellerstein in The Last Five Years (TIC, 2020), Brindsley Miller in Black Comedy (TIC, 2019), and Potiphar in Joseph and the Amazing Technicolor Dreamcoat (Gallery 7, 2019). Sweeney Todd is Michaelâ€™s first show with Secondary Characters. Michael hopes you enjoy the show that the cast & crew have poured their hearts into.
