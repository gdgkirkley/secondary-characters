Aidan is stoked to be in this production of Mamma Mia! Jumping into the role with only a few weeks left before opening has been a wild experience, but has also been so much fun. Some of Aidanâ€™s past credits include Jack Kelly in Newsies, and Mortiz Stiefel in Spring Awakening. Aidan hopes everyone watching lays all their love on this show!!
