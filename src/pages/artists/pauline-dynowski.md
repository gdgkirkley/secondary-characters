Pauline is delighted to return to theatre with *Sweeney Todd* and thinks this light hearted comedy is exactly what we need right now. Pauline feels more people need to know that ye olde pye crusts were called ‘coffyns’ and stuffed with fowl. Thus the chicken leg pulled double duty as both meat and handles. Please follow her cats @mr_colin_furth and @catrickstewart, and her personal shenanigans @fairyprincessp and @everaftercharacterco.
