Michael is very excited to be joining the cast of Mamma Mia this summer. Michael has been performing for most of his life starring in roles such as Gaston in Beauty and the Beast, Lord Farquaad in Shrek: The Musical, and Kristoff in Frozen: The Musical, but this is his first production with Secondary Characters. Michael has recently found a love for choreography. He started choreographing last year for Delta Youth Theatreâ€™s production of Matilda, and most recently assisted Ann Matterson in this production of Mamma Mia! Michael would like to thank his friends and family for the endless support and hopes you enjoy the show!
