Warren was only recently introduced to the world of musical theatre when he was "convinced" to audition for Newbury Art Concepts' production of The Music Man in 2018 and landed the part of Constable Stock. Warren is grateful to Raelyn, Susan, and Randy who introduced him to this world of creative and supportive people, and he's excited to be a part of this production. He hopes it's never too late for an old dog to learn new tricks!
