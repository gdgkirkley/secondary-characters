Randy has been involved in the theatrical arts for over 40 years. His passion for theatre ignited at the age of 14 when he was in the chorus of The Music Man (St. Marys Community Players), where he met and fell in love with his now wife, Susan Newbury. Since then, he has acted, sang, danced, stage managed, designed, directed, and produced dozens of productions locally and in south-western Ontario.  He and his wife, Susan, have raised three beautiful daughters, and he loves to travel in his spare time.  Randy dedicates this performance to his mother who played ABBA records every Saturday while doing housework when he was a child. He only hopes that you, the audience member, enjoy the show as much as heâ€™s had working on it.
