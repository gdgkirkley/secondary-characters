Emily has been active in the theatre community here in Chilliwack since she was 12 years old, getting her start with David Walsh and the Chilliwack Academy of Music. Since then, she has worked with The Chilliwack Players Guild, Rosebud School of Performing Arts, Pacific Theatre, The Chilliwack School of Performing Arts and Creative Outlet.

She earned a diploma in the Performing Arts from Rosebud School of Performing, and sang with Trinity Western University's Chorus and Chamber Choir during her time there.

Previous directing credits include Anne of Green Gables the Musical, Awakenings: A One Act Play, Sabrina Fair, Home for the Hollydaze & In Dreams: A Monologue Night, all under the CPG umbrella.

Last summer, Emily did her first show with Secondary Characters, playing The Witch in Sondheim's Into the Woods. 

This is Emily's first time directing for SC, and she's very excited to herd the cast and crew of Oklahoma, one of Rodgers & Hammerstein's best loved musicals!
