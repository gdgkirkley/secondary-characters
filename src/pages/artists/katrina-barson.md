Katrina Barson

A true triple threat, Katrina has been performing since her early childhood in school productions (Muzzy – Thoroughly Modern Millie, GW Graham Theatre) and at the Chilliwack School of Performing Arts (Belle – Beauty and the Beast, Winnifred – Once Upon a Mattress, Asaka – Once On This Island). You may also know her from some of her community performances with Secondary Characters (Little Red – Into the Woods, Amy – Little Women), Newbury Arts Concepts (Rosie – Bye Bye Birdie) and Theatre Junkies (Gift of the Magi). 

Not only a prolific performer, Katrina also works passionately backstage and has stage-managed, assisted with choreography, and managed both props and costumes for many local arts groups, as well as many years of teaching theatre to youth. After high school graduation, Katrina moved to Toronto to study theatre where she was accepted by both the Music Theatre Performance Program at Sheridan College and the Randolph Academy of Dramatic Arts. She moved back to Chilliwack to pursue her passion of creating professional quality theatrical performances for small town venues and audiences. Katrina is very excited to be making her choreography debut with Secondary Characters and hopes to use her multi-talented skills as a performer to help mentor the cast of Oklahoma!
