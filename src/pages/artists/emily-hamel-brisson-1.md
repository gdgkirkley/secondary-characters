Everything Emily has ever done in her life has led to this moment. From singing in the living room, to donning a top hat and dancing around the stage for her first vocal recital, it is with great pride that she can say today, "Let them eat pie." Check out Emily's wig and sewing work on Instagram at @theatremee, and heck, go check out her princess party company at @everaftercharacterco.
