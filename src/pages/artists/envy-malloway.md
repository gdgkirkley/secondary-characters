Envy is thrilled to be performing in their second production with Secondary Characters, having previously performed in Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street, and to be doing hair and make-up for the show. In high school, Envy performed in Aladdin, The Christmas Carol, and Willy Wonka & The Chocolate Factory. Envy first became interested in musical theatre when they saw Secondary Charactersâ€™ production of The Hunchback of Notre Dame. Envy would like to thank Secondary Characters for the opportunity to partake in another production, and they hope to learn even more about musical theatre in future shows.
