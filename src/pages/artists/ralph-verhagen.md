Ralph is thrilled to be involved in Secondary Characters' production of Mamma Mia! For Ralph, itâ€™s been a while since his performances in Elf: The Musical, The Music Man, Oliver, For Groom The Bell Tolls, and Bye Bye Birdie, so returning to live musical theatre has been wonderful. Ralph has found the enthusiasm and energy of the cast and crew to be invigorating and catchy. In addition to theatre, Ralph also sings in the chorus of the Chilliwack Symphony Orchestra, which restarts this fall after a long hiatus due to covid. Ralph finds virtual theatre and concerts to be okay, but the live music of the performances is magic.
