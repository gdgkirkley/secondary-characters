Lauren is thrilled to be a part of one of her all-time favourite musicals! Lauren has been singing her way through life from a young age. She has performed in *Sunset Boulevard*, *Bye Bye Birdie*, *Oliver*, and most recently Secondary Characters’ production of *Sweeney Todd* as Johanna. This is technically Lauren’s second performance of Mamma Mia. The first was when she was twelve years old and underwent awake surgery. After the surgery, the nurses informed her that she had been singing Mamma Mia the entire surgery. Lauren is thrilled to now be a part of an ‘official’ production of Mamma Mia, thirteen years later, and to be performing for more than a room full of doctors. Lauren would like to give a special thanks to the wonderful cast and crew and especially to her family and grandparents who brought musicals into her life at a young age. To them, she can only say “Thank you for the music.”
