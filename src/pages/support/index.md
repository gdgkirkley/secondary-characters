[Sponsorship Package and Benefits](static/img/seussical-sponsorship-package-2-.pdf)

Much of our success is due to the passionate individuals who volunteer their time and energy to the creative process as well as those generous individuals & companies within the community who offer support to our production.

### Now this is where you come in, we are asking for your help to ensure the success of our future.

We are looking for supporters to help us continue to provide musicals in Chilliwack. Past productions, including *[Little Women](/shows/little-women)*, *You’re a Good Man Charlie Brown*, *The Sound of Music*, *[Joseph and the Amazing Technicolor Dreamcoat](/shows/joseph-and-the-amazing-technicolor-dreamcoat)*, *Into the Woods*, *Oklahoma!*, *The Last Five Years*, *The Wizard of Oz*, *The Hunchback of Notre Dame*, *Elf*, *The 25th Annual Putnam County Spelling Bee, Sweeney Todd, the Demon Barber of Fleet Street, and Mamma Mia!*  have been enthusiastically received by the community. We have played to many sold out audiences and our productions are creatively fulfilling for all members involved. We have been voted favourite local show in the Chilliwack Progress A-list recognising Chilliwack’s finest.

Secondary Characters was founded in 2009 to re-establish a summer musical in Chilliwack, to provide creative opportunities for artists of all ages, and to present imaginative, passionate, and inspiring productions for our community. We recently celebrated 10 years of musical theatre in Chilliwack and your support will continue to help us realize our goal of producing high-quality musicals for audiences across the Valley and continue to discover and grow as an organization.

Thank you in advance for your consideration and support. We look forward to speaking with you in the near future, and invite you to join us  this season for Seussical!

Sincerely,

**Shelley Wojcik**\
