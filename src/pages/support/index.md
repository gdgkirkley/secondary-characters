Secondary Characters Musical Theatre Society is a registered not-for-profit musical theatre company, based in Chilliwack, British Columbia. We present a full scale musical each summer, which combines the talent of performers from across the Fraser Valley, from Hope to Vancouver. The organization is governed by a volunteer Board of Directors.
