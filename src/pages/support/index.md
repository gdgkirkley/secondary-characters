The summer of 2019 will be our **10th Anniversary performance**. Much of our success is due to the passionate individuals who volunteer their time and energy to the creative process as well as those generous individuals & companies within the community who offer support to our production.

### Now this is where you come in, we are asking for your help to ensure the success of our future.

We are looking for supporters to help us continue to provide musicals in Chilliwack. Past productions, including [_Little Women_](/shows/little-women), _You’re a Good Man Charlie Brown_, _The Sound of Music_, [_Joseph and the Amazing Technicolor Dreamcoat_](/shows/joseph-and-the-amazing-technicolor-dreamcoat), _Into the Woods_, _Oklahoma!_, _The Last Five Years_, _The Wizard of Oz_, _The Hunchback of Notre Dame_, and _The 25th Annual Putnam County Spelling Bee_ have been enthusiastically received by the community. We have played to many sold out audiences and our productions are creatively fulfilling for all members involved. We have been voted favourite local show in the Chilliwack Progress A-list recognising Chilliwack’s finest.

Secondary Characters was founded in 2009 to re-establish a summer musical in Chilliwack, to provide creative opportunities for artists of all ages, and to present imaginative, passionate, and inspiring productions for our community. We recently celebrated 10 years of musical theatre in Chilliwack and your support will continue to help us realize our goal of producing high-quality musicals for audiences across the Valley and continue to discover and grow as an organization.

Thank you in advance for your consideration and support. We look forward to speaking with you in the near future, and invite you to join us for both shows this season.

Sincerely,

**Shelley Wojcik**  
Executive Artistic Director  
Secondary Characters
